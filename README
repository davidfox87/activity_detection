# General info

The dataset collects data from a wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest. Uncalibrated Accelerometer Data are collected from 15 participants performing 7 activities.
The dataset is intended for Activity Recognition research purposes. It provides challenges for identification and authentication of people using motion patterns.

In this mini-project, I apply a convolutional neural network model (Tensorflow/Keras) to classify windows of x, y, z time series accelerometer data.
Although, this was a labeled dataset, I also attempted to automatically reproduce these labels by clustering small windows of x, y, z data through 
automatic feature learning using convolutional autoencoders. This is still a work in progress and I am currently learning how to do this.

I uploaded these codes to demostrate the following abilities:

* Excellent understanding of Deep Learning methodologies for time series classification.
* Experience with deep neural network architectures and software frameworks like TensorFlow.
* Programming skills in Python and familiarity with python libraries like numpy, scikit-learn, pandas etc.
